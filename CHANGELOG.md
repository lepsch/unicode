## 1.1.0

## 1.0.0

- Breaking changes: The names of some public fields and functions have been changed. Also, some public library members have been removed or replaced with more effective ones. This was done because this package had not been maintained for quite a long time (more than 3 years). The current implementation is lighter and retains the previous functionality.
- The dependency on the `list` package has been removed. A lighter implementation from the `sparse_list` package is used instead.

## 0.3.1

- This package is no longer supported because it was flagged by Google Dart developers as being published by an unknown person. Publisher Unknown. As a normal person, I believe that hardly anyone would want to use software from unknown publishers.

- The source code has been migrated to null safety.
